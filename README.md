# practice

Please disregard the playground file.  Git commands could not get the information posted to the repo, so I recreated it here.  Now that the repo is working with git I'm going to use this file for practice of React, JSX, and CSS.  I'd like to get all the on.. events figured out.  I think over time I may extend to the back end, but for now I'm working with the frontend only.  There is so much to learn, but it is fun to figure out how to do things.
