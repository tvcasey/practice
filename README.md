# practice

Please disregard the playground file.  Git commands could not get the information posted to the repo, so I recreated it here.  Now that the repo is working with git I'm going to use this file for practice of React, JSX, and CSS.  I'd like to get all the on.. events figured out.  I think over time I may extend to the back end, but for now I'm working with the frontend only.  There is so much to learn, but it is fun to figure out how to do things.

Trying to figure out CSS.  The actual characteristics and descriptions are fairly logical.  Arranging position and styling is done through the App.css, but I'm trying to figure out how to pin point the exact styling to the right className given react bootstrap.  I'll figure it out and once I do I'm going to play with the styling until I get a firm grasp of CSS & Bootstrap.  I think I'll have the eureka moment early this week.

Need to look at Buttonclick4 to try to get the onClick to work.  Then on to the onChange for Log Rocket.

TO FIX NODE_MODULE PROBLEMS AT THE NPM START:

1.  npm cache clean --force
2.  delete node_modules folder
3.  delete package-lock.json file
4.  npm install
